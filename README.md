# Introduction
This repository contains writeups for challenges and machines I've completed on Hack The Box. Each directory corresponds to a specific challenge or machine and contains detailed explanations, methodologies, and solutions.

# Disclaimer
Warning: These writeups contain spoilers! If you're currently working on a challenge or machine and wish to solve it independently, I advise you to refrain from reading further until you've completed it.
